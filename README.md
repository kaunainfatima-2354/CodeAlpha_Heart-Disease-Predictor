# CodeAlpha_Heart-Disease-Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical and lifestyle features.

1. Task: Disease Prediction from Medical Data
Objective: Predict the possibility of diseases based on patient data.
Approach: Apply classification techniques to structured medical datasets.

Key Features:
● Use features like symptoms, age, blood test results, etc.
● Algorithms: SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
● Datasets: Heart disease, Diabetes, Breast Cancer (UCI ML Repository).

3. Features

Preprocesses and encodes medical data, 
Trains a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression / Random Forest depending on your notebook), 
Evaluates model performance, 
Takes custom user input to predict heart-disease risk.

3. Technologies Used:

Python, 
Pandas, 
Scikit-learn, 
Jupyter Notebook. 

4. Workflow:

Load and explore the dataset, 
Clean missing values, 
Encode categorical columns, 
Train classification model, 
Measure accuracy & metrics, 
Predict risk from user-entered values.

Result:
A trained ML model capable of predicting heart disease risk with solid accuracy using key health indicators.
